  abstract = {Genome-scale studies have revealed extensive, cell type-specific colocalization of transcription factors, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoterdistal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

  abstract = {Background: A major goal of molecular biology is determining the mechanisms that control the transcription of genes. Motif Enrichment Analysis (MEA) seeks to determine which DNA-binding transcription factors control the transcription of a set of genes by detecting enrichment of known binding motifs in the genes' regulatory regions. Typically, the biologist specifies a set of genes believed to be co-regulated and a library of known DNA-binding models for transcription factors, and MEA determines which (if any) of the factors may be direct regulators of the genes. Since the number of factors with known DNA-binding models is rapidly increasing as a result of high-throughput technologies, MEA is becoming increasingly useful. In this paper, we explore ways to make MEA applicable in more settings, and evaluate the efficacy of a number of MEA approaches. Results: We first define a mathematical framework for Motif Enrichment Analysis that relaxes the requirement that the biologist input a selected set of genes. Instead, the input consists of all regulatory regions, each labeled with the level of a biological signal. We then define and implement a number of motif enrichment analysis methods. Some of these methods require a user-specified signal threshold, some identify an optimum threshold in a data-driven way and two of our methods are threshold-free. We evaluate these methods, along with two existing methods (Clover and PASTAA), using yeast ChIP-chip data. Our novel threshold-free method based on linear regression performs best in our evaluation, followed by the data-driven PASTAA algorithm. The Clover algorithm performs as well as PASTAA if the userspecified threshold is chosen optimally. Data-driven methods based on three statistical tests--Fisher Exact Test, ranksum test, and multi-hypergeometric test---perform poorly, even when the threshold is chosen optimally. These methods (and Clover) perform even worse when unrestricted data-driven threshold determination is used. Conclusions: Our novel, threshold-free linear regression method works well on ChIP-chip data. Methods using datadriven threshold determination can perform poorly unless the range of thresholds is limited a priori. The limits implemented in PASTAA, however, appear to be well-chosen. Our novel algorithms---AME (Analysis of Motif Enrichment)---are available at http://bioinformatics.org.au/ame/.},

  abstract = {Background: Interleukin-6 (IL-6), as a multifunctional cytokine, was involved in the inflammation microenvironment of muscle regeneration., Results: In mice lacking IL-6, less macrophage recruitment and decreased myoblast proliferation impairs muscle regeneration., Conclusion: In monocytes/macrophages, activation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway is critical to macrophage migration and myoblast proliferation during muscle regeneration., Significance: IL-6/STAT3 pathway is essential for muscle regeneration., Inflammation and microenvironment play a crucial role in muscle regeneration. IL (interleukin)-6, as a multifunctional cytokine is involved in the processes. However, the causative effect of IL-6 in muscle regeneration remains unclear. In a mouse model of cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury/regeneration, infiltrated monocytes/macrophages produce a high level of IL-6 started on 1 day (24 h) after injury. In IL-6 knock-out (-/-) mice, the muscle regeneration procedure was impaired along with decreased myogenic determination factor (MyoD) and myogenin mRNA level and increased interstitial fibrosis. The IL-6-/- mice exhibited less macrophage infiltration, lower inflammatory cytokine (IL-1{$\beta$}, inducible NO synthase, Transforming growth factor (TGF)-{$\beta$}1, and IL-10) and chemokine (CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5) expression, and inhibited myoblast proliferation. In vitro, IL-6 deficiency or Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) knockdown in activated macrophage attenuated the expression of CCL2, CCL3, but not CCL5, which resulted in less macrophage migration. Moreover, inflammatory macrophages promoted myoblast proliferation in an IL-6-dependent manner. Finally, adoptive transfer IL-6+/+ BM cells into IL-6-/- mice rescued the impaired regeneration with improved MyoD and myogenin expression. Taken together, IL-6 expression and the activated STAT3 signaling pathway in monocytes/macrophages is a critical mediator of macrophage migration and myoblast proliferation during muscle regeneration.},

Recent findings indicate that inflammatory responses could play central roles in bridging initial muscle injury responses and timely muscle injury reparation. The various types of immune cells and cytokines have crucial roles in muscle regeneration process. In this review, we briefly summarise the functions of acute inflammation in muscle regeneration. The translational potential of this article Immune system is closely relevant to the muscle regeneration. Understanding the mechanisms of inflammation in muscle regeneration is therefore critical for the development of effective regenerative, and therapeutic strategies in muscular disorders. This review provides information for muscle regeneration research regarding the effects of inflammation on muscle regeneration.},

  abstract = {The Encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) project is a collaborative effort to create a comprehensive catalog of functional elements in the human genome. The current database comprises more than 19000 functional genomics experiments across more than 1000 cell lines and tissues using a wide array of experimental techniques to study the chromatin structure, regulatory and transcriptional landscape of the Homo sapiens and Mus musculus genomes. All experimental data, metadata, and associated computational analyses created by the ENCODE consortium are submitted to the Data Coordination Center (DCC) for validation, tracking, storage, and distribution to community resources and the scientific community. The ENCODE project has engineered and distributed uniform processing pipelines in order to promote data provenance and reproducibility as well as allow interoperability between genomic resources and other consortia. All data files, reference genome versions, software versions, and parameters used by the pipelines are captured and available via the ENCODE Portal. The pipeline code, developed using Docker and Workflow Description Language (WDL; https://openwdl.org/) is publicly available in GitHub, with images available on Dockerhub (https://hub.docker.com), enabling access to a diverse range of biomedical researchers. ENCODE pipelines maintained and used by the DCC can be installed to run on personal computers, local HPC clusters, or in cloud computing environments via Cromwell. Access to the pipelines and data via the cloud allows small labs the ability to use the data or software without access to institutional compute clusters. Standardization of the computational methodologies for analysis and quality control leads to comparable results from different ENCODE collections - a prerequisite for successful integrative analyses.

We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression.
